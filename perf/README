Prerequisites:
Refer prerequisites.txt in the same directory.

Execution:
Identify the IP addresses of the source and destination using the ifconfig command.
Ensure that the IP address of the destination is reachable from the source through a ping command.

Sanity test using ping:
E.g. assume source IP address as 10.3.4.2 and destination IP address as 10.4.5.10.
On 10.3.4.2:

# ping 10.4.5.10
PING 10.4.5.10 (10.4.5.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.4.5.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=61 time=2.88 ms
64 bytes from 10.4.5.10: icmp_seq=2 ttl=61 time=2.05 ms

If a ping works as above, now ensure that the source and destination can communicate using iperf3. 
The iperf3 server listens on the well-known port 5201. Therefore, the destination should be enabled to allow incoming traffic on port 5201.
Once this is done, do a sanity test using iperf3:

On 10.4.5.10 (destination):
# iperf3 -s
-----------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on 5201
-----------------------------------------------------------

On 10.3.4.2 (source):
# iperf3 -c 10.4.5.10
Connecting to host 10.4.5.10, port 5201
[  4] local 10.3.4.2 port 46102 connected to 10.4.5.10 port 5201
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth       Retr  Cwnd
[  4]   0.00-1.00   sec  62.5 MBytes   524 Mbits/sec   12   1.51 MBytes
[  4]   1.00-2.00   sec  62.5 MBytes   524 Mbits/sec    4   1.51 MBytes
[  4]   2.00-3.00   sec  63.8 MBytes   535 Mbits/sec    0   1.51 MBytes
..........
.............

If an output of the above form is seen on the source (client), a similar output is seen on the destination (server) as well. This implies iperf3 communication is ok.

Now refer to the iperf3 help and identify the set of options to execute.
The options supported by iperf3_test.py script (a subset of options within iperf3):
-t : time in seconds to transmit for
-P : Number of parallel client streams to run
-i : seconds between periodic bandwidth reports
-c : server IP address to connect to

e.g. 
# iperf3 -c 10.4.5.10 -i 2 -t 10 -P 2
Connect to 10.4.5.10 and trasmit for 10 seconds over 2 parallel streams, and show bandwidth reports every 2 seconds.

Once the above is done,
identify the VPN gateway ID and the id of the VPN connection on this gateway to work with.

start the iperf3 server (iperf3 -s) on the destination (if not already running).

On the source, start iperf3_test.py as:
# python3 iperf3_test.py
 space separated list of options for the iperf3 command
-c 10.4.5.10 -i 2 -t 10 -P 2
['-c', '10.4.5.10', '-i', '2', '-t', '10', '-P', '2']

In order to get the VPN gateway and gateway connection ids, on the source with bx installed,
# bx is vpns

# bx is vpns
Listing vpn gateways under account net 2 as user abc@def.com...
ID                                 Name                Subnet                         Public IP         Resource group            VPN connections                      Created    Status

Enter the VPN gateway and gateway connection ids as seen in the above output, separated by a space

227f319-ca7-4512-bb5-f4089585 e212-83f-48d-a96-bd1a924

Once the run completes, a summary_<timestamp>.csv file is generated in the local directory along with one .json file per combination (e.g. IKE/IPSec combination).
